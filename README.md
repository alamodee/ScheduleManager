# ScheduleManager
====  
This is my term project of 12780 Advanced Python and Web Prototyping for Infrastructure Systems, Fall 17 at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Description
This is my first project using Django.  I used Bootstrap framework for responsive user interface.
ScheduleManager is a simple Web application which has two modules. The first is Schedule Module. Schedule has an attribute of id, name, date, place, and note. Schedule module simply shows information of each event, and store it in the database.   
The second module is Discussion. Discussion is a child of schedule, and stores discussion which have occurred in a related event. Discussion stores id and its content, and it will show the list of discussion.   
Schedule and discussion are connected each other, in order to notify the newest information of the event to the user.
